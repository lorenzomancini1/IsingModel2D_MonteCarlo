# Monte Carlo methods and finite size analysis in paramagnetic-ferromagnetic models of phase transitions
## Description and assignments
The objective is to study, by Monte Carlo simulations, Ising-like modes on the square lattice and look at the behaviour of observables such as the specific heat, magnetisation and magnetic susceptibility, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\chi">, as a function of the temperature ed in particular in proximity of the critical point (exactly known in d = 2 due to the Onsager solution).
